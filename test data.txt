“Ah…” Petunia said.

<p>“It wasn’t bending spoons -”</p>

<p>“I’ll - have to think about this,” he said, trying to keep his voice under control.</p>

“Well, the letter got here somehow,” Harry said, “so I’ll just wave it around outside and call ‘letter for Hogwarts!’ and see if an owl picks it up.

<p class="calibre2">A blur was coming over Harry’s vision, as his brain started to comprehend what had just broken. The whole idea of a unified universe with mathematically regular laws, that was what had been flushed down the toilet; the whole notion of <em class="calibre4">physics</em>.
